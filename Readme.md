# Cen'py Game Engine

Cen'py is a C++23 game engine designed for visual novels, inspired by Ren'py, a Python game engine specialized in visual novels (VN). The name is a playful combination of "Ren'py" and "Senpai," paying homage to Japan, the birthplace of visual novels.

## Features

- **ECS Architecture:** Cen'py is built on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, providing a flexible and scalable foundation for game development.

- **Scripting Language:** The engine will incorporates a compiled script language similar to Ren'py, making it easy to create interactive and narrative-driven visual novels.

- **OpenGL3 and GLFW:** Cen'py utilizes OpenGL3 for graphics rendering and GLFW for window management, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

- **Desktop and Mobile Support:** Cen'py is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile platforms, offering versatility for game developers.

- **Build System:** Conan and CMake are used for handling dependencies and building the project, streamlining the development process.

## System Requirements

- **GCC >= 13.2:** Cen'py requires GCC version 13.2 or higher for compilation.

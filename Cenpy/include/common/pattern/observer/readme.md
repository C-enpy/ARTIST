# C++ Observer Pattern Framework

This C++ code defines a framework for implementing the observer pattern. The observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, that are notified of any state changes. The code uses a combination of class delegates and macros to simplify the implementation.

## Class Delegates and Macros

The framework includes a system for creating class-level delegates (`MethodDelegate`) and managing them using a `ClassDelegate`. Delegates support hooks that can be executed before and after invoking a method. Macros are used to streamline the creation and usage of these delegates.

### Macros

- **METHOD_IMPLEMENTATION:** Generates method implementations that delegate the call to a `ClassDelegate`.
- **CLASS_DELEGATE:** Macro for creating a class delegate with before and after hooks.
- **NAMED_METHOD_PAIR:** Generates pairs of method names and corresponding `MethodDelegate` instances.

## Observer Pattern

The code defines interfaces for the observer pattern:

- **Subject:** An object that wishes to notify other objects about changes in its state.
- **Observer:** An object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system.

## FakeClass and FakeObserver

To demonstrate the observer pattern, the code includes a simple class (`FakeClass`) with a single integer property. An observer class (`FakeObserver`) updates its `updatedValue` when notified of changes in `FakeClass`.

## Usage

The provided unit tests use Google Test (`#include <gtest/gtest.hpp>`) to validate the functionality of the observer pattern. The `FakeClass` is used as a subject with the `setValue` method delegated through the observer pattern.

## Subject Macro (SUBJECT)

The `SUBJECT` macro is used to create a subject class with observer pattern support. For example:

```cpp
SUBJECT(FakeClass, setValue)
```

This creates a `FakeClassSubject` with the observer pattern capabilities.
